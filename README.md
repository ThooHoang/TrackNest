# 💰 TrackNest

## 📄 Overview

**TrackNest** is my most ambitious and complete project so far, and the one I’m most proud to include in my portfolio.  

For a long time, I struggled to find a finance app that truly fit my needs – something simple, clear, and customizable where I could set a budget and get a beautiful overview of my finances. With TrackNest, I wanted to **solve a real problem in my own life** and make my daily financial planning easier.  

This project taught me a lot about design, coding, and how to bring an idea to life.  

## 🚀 Features

- **Landing Page** – with a modern design that introduces the app  
- **Start Planning Button** – takes you directly to the finance dashboard  
- **Dashboard** – manage budgets and track expenses  
- **LocalStorage** – keeps data saved locally in the browser  
- **Custom Branding** – I designed the full brand identity, logo, and UI in **Figma**  
- **Responsive Design** – optimized for desktop and mobile  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure built entirely by me  
- **CSS3** – full custom styling created from scratch  
- **JavaScript** – I wrote the logic myself with some AI assistance to learn and improve faster  


## 🔮 Future Plans

I’m still at the beginning of my developer journey, but I have big plans for TrackNest:  

- Build a **backend** so users can log in and save their data in a database  
- Add **AI-powered insights** that provide a monthly overview with suggestions on how to improve spending habits  
- Learn to work with **APIs** and connect with real-world services (e.g., integrating with payment apps like Lunar so every transaction automatically appears in the dashboard)  

## 🙌 Motivation

This project is special to me because it’s not just practice – it’s a **solution to a real-life problem I had**.  
I discovered a problem, fixed it with code, and created something useful. That’s why I’m proud of TrackNest.
